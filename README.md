# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-SQL

In this project, a comprehensive data analysis were conducted leveraging SQL on a complex pizza sales dataset comprising 12 distinct columns encompassing key attributes like pizza ID, order ID, order date, pizza name, pizza category, order time, unit price, pizza size, and pizza ingredients. Guided by the business problem and key performance indicators (KPIs), I meticulously examined aspects such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, total orders, and average pizzas per order. To enhance the insights derived, I harnessed the capabilities of Power BI, employing Power Query for adept data transformation and DAX queries to facilitate advanced calculations. Subsequently, I harnessed Power BI's visualization prowess to craft interactive dashboards that fostered intuitive data exploration. The culmination of this endeavor was the formulation of a comprehensive report, artfully composed using Microsoft Word, encapsulating the findings and insights distilled from the data analysis journey.
